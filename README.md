# Honeypot
Assignment 10/11 was my first time working with google VM's. I used the one honeypot that was mentioned in the assignment walk through; ! didn't create more than one. The only real issues that I had with the assignment was ! have never done anything like this in the past so everything including the VM set up was completely new to me.

My honeypot collected 15 attacks in 1 day window
